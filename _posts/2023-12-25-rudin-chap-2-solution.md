This is my attempt on solving problems in Chapter 2 of Rudin's Principle of
Mathematical Analysis (a.k.a. Baby Rudin).

1. For any set $$A, B$$ we have $$A \cup B \subseteq A$$. Let $$A$$ be an
  arbitrary set, and $$A^C$$ be its complement, therefore
  $$
  \emptyset = A \cup A^C \subseteq A.
  $$
